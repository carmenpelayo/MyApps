st.write("I built a machine learning model to predict energy consumption in buildings with minimal data. I implemented an autoML system for time series (autoTS) and identified the ExtraTreeRegressor algorithm as the best-performing estimator. The resulting model, which was trained over a >1.4M records dataset, led to an accuracy of 83% (on R-squared score) on unseen data. This enabled the creation of a system that predicts the optimal energy load in a building and adjusts the temperature accordingly to avoid electricity waste.")
